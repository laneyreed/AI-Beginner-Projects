# 🤖 AI-Beginner-Projects

- 👩🏿‍💻 [Simple AI Agent](./ai_agent/README.md)
    - uses langchain to create an AI agent that can perform calculations and chat with the user
    - uses ChatOpenAI model from langchain_openai module and defines a simple calculator tool

- 📄 [AI Resume Critiquer](./ai_resume_critiquer/README.md)
    - allows users to upload their resumes and get AI-generated critiques
    - using the OpenAI GPT-4o-mini model from the openai module
    - streamlit is used to create the web interface

- 🖼️ [AI Image Classifier](./ai_image_classifier/README.md)
    - pretrained machine learning model that can look at an image and classify it
    - image manipulations
    - streamlit is used to create the web interface


<!-- - Open AI API LLM
    - LLM(Large Language Models)
        - types of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text, and often handle other tasks like coding, data analysis, and creative writing
        - something like GPT-4, Grok, Claude 3,7 or deepseek
            - these are all competing frontier AI models, each with specific strengths and target use cases, ranging from general utility (GPT-4) to real-time data access (Grok), safety/long context (Claude), and cost efficiency (DeepSeek) -->
