- Open AI API LLM
    - LLM(Large Language Models)
        - types of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human-like text, and often handle other tasks like coding, data analysis, and creative writing
        - something like GPT-4, Grok, Claude 3,7 or deepseek
            - these are all competing frontier AI models, each with specific strengths and target use cases, ranging from general utility (GPT-4) to real-time data access (Grok), safety/long context (Claude), and cost efficiency (DeepSeek)
