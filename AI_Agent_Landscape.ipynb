    "\n",
    "**5 components form the foundation of the agent** \n",
    "1. LLM(Large Language Model)\n",
    "    - like the brain(reasoning engine) of the agent that understands task, making decisions, natural language and generating respponses\n",
    "    - OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropis's Claude, Ollama etc....\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prompt Templates & Resoning Strategies\n",
    "    - Prompt Templates\n",
    "        - pre-designed text structures that help guide your LLM's response\n",
    "        - the instructions you give to your AI to get useful answers\n",
    "        - should clearly explain the task, provide context and specify the format of the response\n",
    "    - Resoning Strategies\n",
    "        - **ReAct**: Reasoning, then Act\n",
    "            - agent thinks through a problem step by step before taking action\n",
    "        - **Plan-And-Execute**\n",
    "            - simialr to `ReAct` but it separates the planning phase from the execution phase\n",
    "        - **Reflexion** encourages the agent to reflect on its previous actions to improve ifs future performance\n",
    "3. Tools & Actions\n",
    "    - allow the agent to interact with the world\n",
    "    - without tools your agent is just a chatbot, it can talk but it cannot do anything\n",
    "    - tools give your agent the ability to take actions beyond just gnerating text\n",
    "    - searching, api calls, file operations, executing code etc....\n",
    "4. Memory & State Management\n",
    "     without memory your agent would not remember anything\n",
    "     - memory systems store information from past interactions, so the agent can maintain context overtime\n",
    "     - buffer memory(recent converstion history), vector search capabilities(store and retrive information from a knowledge base)\n",
    "     json(to store and keep track of structured data)\n",
    "5. Control Loop\n",
    "    - the heart of the agent\n",
    "    - decision making process that determines what the agent does next\n",
    "    - continuously cycles through observing the current state deciding what actions to take based on goals and available tools, executing that action observing the result and then repeating the process\n",

    "## Common Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**\n",
    "    - Agent thinks through a problem step-by-step before taking action\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan-And-Execute\n",
    "- **What it is:** Separates planning phase from execution phase (unlike ReAct which interleaves them)\n",
    "- **How it works:**\n",
    "  1. Plan: Agent creates a full plan to solve the task\n",
    "  2. Execute: Agent executes the plan step-by-step\n",
    "  3. Observe: Agent monitors results\n",
    "  4. Replan if needed\n",
    "- **Best for:** Complex multi-step tasks where planning upfront saves time\n",
    "- **Example:** \"Plan: 1) Search for weather 2) Format result 3) Return answer → Execute each step\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** More efficient, structured approach, better for complex workflows\n",
    "- **Cons:** Rigid plans may fail if environment changes unexpectedly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflexion\n",
    "- **What it is:** Agent reflects on its previous actions and outcomes to improve future performance\n",
    "- **How it works:**\n",
    "  1. Act: Agent takes an action\n",
    "  2. Observe: Get the result\n",
    "  3. Reflect: Agent analyzes what went wrong or right\n",
    "  4. Learn: Agent updates its strategy based on reflection\n",
    "  5. Retry: Agent attempts again with improved approach\n",
    "- **Best for:** Learning from mistakes, iterative problem solving, self-correction\n",
    "- **Example:** \"I tried approach A and failed. Let me reflect on why. Now I'll try approach B with lessons learned\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Improves over time, self-correcting, more robust\n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires extra LLM calls for reflection, slower\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Use / Function Calling\n",
    "- **What it is:** Agent selects and calls appropriate tools/functions to accomplish goals\n",
    "- **How it works:**\n",
    "  1. Agent analyzes the task\n",
    "  2. Agent decides which tool is best\n",
    "  3. Agent calls the tool with parameters\n",
    "  4. Tool returns result\n",
    "  5. Agent processes result and continues\n",
    "- **Best for:** Any agent that interacts with APIs, databases, search engines, calculators\n",
    "- **Tools examples:** Web search, Calculator, Database queries, API calls, File operations\n",
    "- **Pros:** Extends agent capabilities beyond text generation\n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires well-defined tools, tool selection errors compound\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Orchestration (Crew AI pattern)\n",
    "- **What it is:** Multiple specialized agents work together with defined roles and responsibilities\n",
    "- **How it works:**\n",
    "  1. Manager Agent: Assigns tasks to specialized agents\n",
    "  2. Specialist Agents: Each handles specific domain/task\n",
    "  3. Agents collaborate and pass results to each other\n",
    "  4. Final result is aggregated\n",
    "- **Best for:** Complex problems requiring expertise across multiple domains\n",
    "- **Example:** Research paper writing → Research Agent gathers info → Writer Agent writes → Editor Agent reviews\n",
    "- **Pros:** Modular, scalable, specialized expertise\n",
    "- **Cons:** Coordination overhead, more complex to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Agentic Loop (Core Control Loop Pattern)\n",
    "- **What it is:** The fundamental loop that powers all agents - observe → decide → act → repeat\n",
    "- **Structure:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  while not goal_reached:\n",
    "      1. Observe: Get current state/context\n",
    "      2. Decide: Use LLM to choose next action\n",
    "      3. Act: Execute the chosen action/tool\n",
    "      4. Feedback: Observe result, update context\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Best for:** Foundation pattern for all agent architectures\n",
    "- **Pros:** Simple, universal, flexible\n",
    "- **Cons:** Requires good decision logic (LLM quality matters)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pattern | Reasoning | Planning | Execution | Reflection | Multi-Agent | Best For |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **ReAct** | Yes | No | Interleaved | No | No | Step-by-step reasoning |\n",
    "| **Plan-And-Execute** | Yes | Yes | Sequential | Limited | No | Complex structured tasks |\n",
    "| **Reflexion** | Yes | No | Iterative | Yes | No | Learning and improvement |\n",
    "| **Tool Use** | Yes | No | Direct calls | No | No | API/External interactions |\n",
    "| **Multi-Agent** | Yes | Yes | Distributed | Limited | Yes | Complex multi-domain tasks |\n",
    "| **Agentic Loop** | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible | Yes | Any agent application |\n",
    "\n",
    "### How They Work Together\n",
    "- Most modern agents combine multiple patterns\n",
    "- For example: An agent might use **Plan-And-Execute** (planning phase) + **ReAct** (execution phase with reasoning) + **Reflexion** (when hitting errors)\n",
    "- **Tool Use** is orthogonal - can be added to any pattern\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent** orchestration uses any of the above patterns for individual agents"
